Today is the first day of 2020 and I will not set any goals or resolutions. The only goal is **to set no goals**.

So, I get rid of the panic and stress of the New Year in mode of "[Carpe Diem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem)". 
I will always keep in mind,  

>"[Yesterday is history,  
tomorrow is a mystery,   
and today is a gift––that is why it is called the present.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeOLas58buw)” 


I [**embrace the flow**](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness).  
I start the new year with no pressure on my back.  
I remain open to discover my potential,  receptive to change and accept my shortcomings.  

>"[God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
Courage to change the things I can,  
And wisdom to know the difference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer)"

The feelings that this New Year will bring to me is:
* a feeling of release
* a feeling of newness
* a feeling of being free.

This will support me to synchronize with the universe to move forward and be contented with myself.

Now it is time to let it flow!.
